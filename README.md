This is a Real-Time Whiteboard Collaboration Webapp made using sockets! Multiple people can view and edit a whiteboard at the same time. This is my personal favourite project!

## Technologies Used

1. Vanilla JS 
2. Socket.io 
3. SASS 
4. HTML

## How it's made

During the Covid Pandamic, a lot of teachers were using online Realtime Whiteboards to teach their students which inspired me to try my hand at making such a website. It has been written entirely in Vanilla Javascript. Websockets have been used to allow users to collaborate on the same whiteboard and see eachother's writings in realtime. No outside library was used to build the whiteboard. The toughest part was coding the 'zoom' and the 'pan' function but I was eventually successful in doing so.
